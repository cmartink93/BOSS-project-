# BOSS-project-
A project from when I was a graduate research assistant at Penn State University working with Dr. Matt Kumjian 
of the Meteorology &amp; Atmospheric Sciences department. The work has published two papers so far.
To protect the work of my team, I cannot upload a bulk of the code. I have uploaded a small sample. All coding
was done in MatLAB.
